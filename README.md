## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have npm and git installed locally.

### Setup

### Install

Once the repository has been cloned, navigate into the cloned folder and run `npm install` to install the required packages.

### Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Running Tests

Run the following command to run the tests.

`npm run test --env=jsdom`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. The env flag is **very important** in order to mock the browser functionality.

### Deployment

You can deploy the production build to netlify or any other hosting service of your choice after running the command below.

`npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!
